PROBLEM STATEMENT:
    A Mobile Phone manufacturing company wants to launch its three brand new phone into the market, 
    but before going with its traditional marketing approach this time it want to analyze the data of 
    its previous model sales in different regions and you have been hired as an Data Scientist to help 
    them out, use the Association rules concept and provide your insights to the companyâ€™s marketing team 
    to improve its sales


Business Problem:
    1.1.	What is the business objective?
    - Maximize:Maximize the overall sales by promoting phone models that are frequently associated with each other.
    - Minimize:Minimize marketing costs by focusing on targeted strategies

Business Constraints:
    -constraints:Maintain or improve customer satisfaction by considering customer preferences and purchasing patterns.

DataFrame:
  User         Data Type                          Description

 Red         Categorical      Preference for the color red (1: liked, 0: not liked) 
 White       Categorical      Preference for the color white (1: liked, 0: not liked) 
 Green       Categorical      Preference for the color green (1: liked, 0: not liked) 
 Yellow      Categorical      Preference for the color yellow (1: liked, 0: not liked)
