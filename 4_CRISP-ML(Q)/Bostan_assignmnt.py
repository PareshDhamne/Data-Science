Objectives:
    Minimize: reduce the rate of crime in the down
    Maximize: Increase the proportion of non_retail businesss by increasing the number of opportunites to the lower status of the popi]ulation

Business constraints:Ensure that all lower status population will get some work and will help to increase the business by providing them good facilities.

Dataset: Boston
This dataset contains information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston,Massachusetts. 
The dataset has 506 rows, each representing a different house in the area. 
There are 14 columns, each representing a different aspect of the houses and their surroundings. 
Following is the details of the columns:

crim: This is the per capita crime rate by town.
zn: This is the proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
indus: This is the proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
chas: This is a Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
nox: This is the nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
rm: This is the average number of rooms per dwelling.
age: This is the proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
dis: This is the weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
rad: This is the index of accessibility to radial highways.
tax: This is the full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
ptratio: This is the pupil-teacher ratio by town.
b: This is calculated as 1000(Bk â€“ 0.63)^2, where Bk is the proportion of people of African American descent by town.
lstat: This is the percentage lower status of the population.
medv: This is the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s and is often the target variable in regression problems.
